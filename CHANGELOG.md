## Release 0.7.0

This release requires Bazel 7 or newer.

By default - when using Bzlmod for dependency management - Stardoc now uses
`@stardoc` as its repo name.

For compatibility with the legacy WORKSPACE-based setup (which used
`@io_bazel_stardoc` as the repo name) and ease of migration, you may load
Stardoc via
```bzl
bazel_dep(name = "stardoc", repo_name = "io_bazel_stardoc", ...)
```
in your `MODULE.bazel` file.

**New Features**

- Add support for a table of contents template (#203). This is disabled by
  default, but Stardoc comes with an example template that you can use. To
  enable, set `table_of_contents_template`, for example:
  ```bzl
  stardoc(
      ...,
      table_of_contents_template = "@stardoc//stardoc:templates/markdown_tables/table_of_contents.vm",
  )
  ```
- Add support for a footer template (#206). This is disabled by default; to
  enable, set `footer_template` to a .vm file, which you will need to provide.
- Add support for providing stamping to Stardoc templates (#205). To use,
  use `$util.formatBuildTimestamp` and `$stamping` in a template file
  (`footer_template` - see above - is recommended for this); for example:
  ```vm
  Built on `$util.formatBuildTimestamp($stamping.volatile.BUILD_TIMESTAMP, "UTC", "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm")`
  ```
- Render documentation for provider `init` callbacks (#224)
- Properly render `*args`, `*`, and `**kwargs` in summaries (#231). This requires
  Bazel 8 (prerelease 20240603 or newer).
- Include `load` statement in summaries (#216)

**Incompatible Changes**

- The legacy extractor has been removed (#212). Stardoc always uses the
  `starlark_doc_extract`-based extractor. The `stardoc`, `semantic_flags`, and
  `use_starlark_doc_extract` arguments to `stardoc()` macro have been removed.
- Stardoc uses Bzlmod by default for dependency management (#213). This means
  that by default, Stardoc now uses `@stardoc` as its repo name.

## Release 0.6.2

Bugfix release: bumps `rules_jvm_external` dependency to support building with
`--incompatible_disable_starlark_host_transitions`

**Contributors**

## Release 0.6.1

Bugfix release: fix `rules_jvm_external` pin warnings.

This release temporarily restores compatibility with Bazel 5 (manually tested).
Note that normally we only test Stardoc with the current stable Bazel and with
Bazel at HEAD - not with older releases. We make no promises about maintaining
compatibility with Bazel 5.

## Release 0.6.0

**New Features**

-   Stardoc no longer escapes HTML tags in documentation. Feel free to
    use HTML formatting in your docs! We now also have much-improved
    rendering for fenced code blocks in attribute docs, and render attribute
    default values using Markdown instead of HTML markup. (#161, #167)
-   Stardoc now dedents and trims all doc strings - not only in macros (#170).
    This means you can have

    ```bzl
    my_rule = rule(
        doc = """
        This is my rule.

        Here is more info about it.

        ...
        """,
        ...
    )
    ```

    and Stardoc will dedent and trim the doc to

    ```
    This is my rule.

    Here is more info about it.

    ...
    ```
-   When using Bazel 7 or newer (or current Bazel HEAD), Stardoc will by
    default use the native `starlark_doc_extract` rule internally (#166).

    This means, in particular:
    *   correct default values for rule attributes in all cases
    *   documentation for module extensions
    *   more complete documentation for repository rules
    *   by default (this can be turned off via `render_main_repo_name = False`),
        we will render labels in your main repo with a repo component: your
        main module name (when using bzlmod) or WORKSPACE name (#168).

    You may temporarily disable the new extractor by calling Stardoc with
    `use_starlark_doc_extract = False`. However, after Bazel 7 is released,
    we plan to remove this argument and always use the new extractor.

**Incompatible Changes**

-   The Markdown renderer now uses Google EscapeVelocity instead of Apache
    Velocity for templating. The templating engines are _almost_ compatible,
    with the exception of escapes in string literals: if in your template you
    had a string literal with a character escape, you would need to expand it.

    For example, instead of

    ```velocity
    ${funcInfo.docString.replaceAll("\n", " ")}
    ```

    you would need

    ```velocity
    ${funcInfo.docString.replaceAll("
    ", " ")}
    ```
-   When using the native `starlark_doc_extract` extractor, Stardoc requires
    two additional templates: `repository_rule_template` and
    `module_extension_template`. If you are using custom templates, you will
    probably want to define these, following the examples in
    `stardoc/templates/markdown_tables`.
-   When using the native `starlark_doc_extract` extractor, Stardoc cannot
    document generated .bzl files any more - because Bazel cannot `load()`
    generated .bzl files.

**Other Notable Changes**

-   The Markdown renderer's source now lives in the Stardoc repo; we build the
    renderer from source instead of using a bundled jar. Unfortunately, if you
    are not using bzlmod, this requires a rather complicated WORKSPACE setup;
    see https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/releases/tag/0.6.0

## Release 0.4.0

First release of **Stardoc** under the new repository location
[bazelbuild/stardoc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc). Please use this
repository for future Stardoc releases instead of its old location. See
[Getting Started](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/blob/4378e9b6bb2831de7143580594782f538f461180/docs/getting_started_stardoc.md)
for updated setup information.

There are **many** new features since the last release. A summary of major
features:

-   Changed the default Stardoc output format to use pure-markdown tables
    instead of HTML tables. This output format is fully compatible with markdown
    formatting constructs. For example, use `**bold**` instead of `<b>bold</b>`.
    The `<`. and `>` characters are escaped in this output format.
-   Stardoc now supports custom formatting. See
    [Custom Output documentation](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/blob/4378e9b6bb2831de7143580594782f538f461180/docs/advanced_stardoc_usage.md#custom-output)
    for details.
-   `aspect()` definitions are now documented by Stardoc.
-   Module definitions (structs which combine series of functions in a
    'namespace') are now documetned by Stardoc.
-   Attribute default-value information is now included in output.

**Huge Thanks to [kendalllaneee](https://github.com/kendalllaneee) and
[blossommojekwu](https://github.com/blossommojekwu) for their work on many of
the features in this release.**
