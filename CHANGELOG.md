## Release 0.4.0

First release of **Stardoc** under the new repository location
[bazelbuild/stardoc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc). Please use this
repository for future Stardoc releases instead of its old location. See
[Getting Started](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/blob/4378e9b6bb2831de7143580594782f538f461180/docs/getting_started_stardoc.md)
for updated setup information.

There are **many** new features since the last release. A summary of major
features:

-   Changed the default Stardoc output format to use pure-markdown tables
    instead of HTML tables. This output format is fully compatible with markdown
    formatting constructs. For example, use `**bold**` instead of `<b>bold</b>`.
    The `<`. and `>` characters are escaped in this output format.
-   Stardoc now supports custom formatting. See
    [Custom Output documentation](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/blob/4378e9b6bb2831de7143580594782f538f461180/docs/advanced_stardoc_usage.md#custom-output)
    for details.
-   `aspect()` definitions are now documented by Stardoc.
-   Module definitions (structs which combine series of functions in a
    'namespace') are now documetned by Stardoc.
-   Attribute default-value information is now included in output.

**Huge Thanks to [kendalllaneee](https://github.com/kendalllaneee) and
[blossommojekwu](https://github.com/blossommojekwu) for their work on many of
the features in this release.**
