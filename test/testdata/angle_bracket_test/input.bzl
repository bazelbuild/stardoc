"""Input file to test angle bracket bug (https://github.com/bazelbuild/skydoc/issues/186)

See https://github.com/bazelbuild/skydoc/issues/186,
https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/issues/132,
and https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/issues/137.

<b>HTML formatting</b> can be used in docstrings, just as in regular Markdown.
Literal angle brackets can be obtained by escaping them with a backslash, where
the backslash itself must be escaped for use in a Starlark docstring
(`\\\\<` becomes \\<), or by using HTML entities (`&lt;` becomes &lt;).
Angle brackets are also preserved in inline code blocks (`#include <vector>`).
